    <h1>iife function</h1>
    <p>An IIFE (Immediately Invoked Function Expression) is a JavaScript function that runs as soon as it is defined. The name IIFE is promoted by Ben Alman in his blog  It is a design pattern which is also known as a Self-Executing Anonymous Function and contains two major parts:

    </p>
    <ol><li>The first is the anonymous function with lexical scope enclosed within the Grouping Operator (). This prevents accessing variables within the IIFE idiom as well as polluting the global scope.
    </li>
    <li>The second part creates the immediately invoked function expression () through which the JavaScript engine will directly interpret the function.</li></ol>
