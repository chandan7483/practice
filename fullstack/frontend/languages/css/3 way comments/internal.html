    <h1>internal css</h1>
    <p> Internal CSS, also known as embedded CSS is a method of adding CSS rules directly to the head section of an HTML document. It involves using the style element to enclose the CSS code within the HTML document itself. Internal CSS is placed within the head section of the HTML document, typically after the documentâ€™s title and before any other content.</p>
