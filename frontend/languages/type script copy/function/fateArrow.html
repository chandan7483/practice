    <h1>fate arrow function</h1>
    <p>Arrow functions have some notable characteristics:</p>
    <ol><li>No this binding: Unlike traditional functions, arrow functions do not have their own this context. They inherit the this value from the enclosing function or context. This makes them particularly useful in scenarios where maintaining the value of this can be tricky, like in event handlers.</li>
    <li>Implicit return: If the arrow function consists of only a single expression, that expression is implicitly returned. You don't need to use the return keyword. If there are curly braces {}, you need to use the return keyword explicitly.

    </li></ol>
